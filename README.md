## Projects

### [TP1 - ThreeJS Basics](tp1)

- (items briefly describing main strong points)
- Scene
  - The scene created during the development of Project tp1 consists of the dining room of a house in Paris (visible from the window) during a birthday celebration. This room is made up of several paintings: two of two people and another of a car. Also visible is a window that acts as a light source, allowing the space to be illuminated by external light. As for the other objects that make up the scene, we have a lamp that serves as local lighting for the room and a table. This table has a cake with a candle, a slice of which is missing, on a plate also placed on the table. Near the cake is a bottle of water and a glass, as well as a spring, a newspaper and a vase with a flower.
