## Projects

### [TP1 - ThreeJS Basics](tp1)

- Highlights
  * Jar - Builded using nurbs and using seamless texture in order to recreate an actual ceramic vase.
  * Bottle - Using nurbs with a transparent material we could simulate glass and with the help of a cylinder on the inside it was possible to replicate a liquid inside.
  * Window - The window allows light from the outside to enter through the window simulating the sun rays, contributing for a better illumination.
  * Board Suport Illumination - The little suport with small spotlights above boards make them look nicer.


- Scene
  - The scene created during the development of Project tp1 consists of the dining room of a house in Paris (visible from the window) during a birthday celebration. This room is made up of several paintings: two of two people and another of a car. Also visible is a window that acts as a light source, allowing the space to be illuminated by external light. As for the other objects that make up the scene, we have a lamp that serves as local lighting for the room and a table. This table has a cake with a candle, a slice of which is missing, on a plate also placed on the table. Near the cake is a bottle of water and a glass, as well as a spring, a newspaper and a vase with a flower.
